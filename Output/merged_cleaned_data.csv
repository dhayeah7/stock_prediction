Recessions, corrections, and financial crises often shake out weak hands, while savvy investors accumulate assets at discounted prices. Looking back at past downturns, one truth remains: those who maintain a long-term vision and strategically deploy capital come out ahead. Data from past recessions shows that the average downturn lasts about 11 months, with stock market recoveries spanning 12 to 24 months. The 2008 financial crisis, which wiped out trillions in wealth, set the stage for one of the greatest bull runs in history. Investors who took bold positions in quality companies during that period saw exponential returns over the following decade.

This collaboration takes advantage of Itron&#39;s distributed intelligence technology, accelerating the path to bring grid edge intelligence to the utility control center. This will improve grid reliability by establishing high-bandwidth, real-time and scalable data integration between the companies&#39; systems and enable the use of AI and big data analytics. For utilities, this means unlocking a range of new use cases that improve overall efficiency of the distribution system, its reliability and service restoration during unplanned events. This collaboration of industry leaders in grid edge intelligence, energy management, automation, AI, data, and analytics will further enable utilities to manage the electric distribution grid with a myriad of use cases that require central control system applications to share enormous amounts of data with low latency. The companies are bringing to market a non-wires solution that addresses utility challenges during a critical period of infrastructure constraints where lead times for components like transformers are upwards of one to two years. With this non-wires solution, utilities can optimize the grid edge and central control system, enhancing grid capacity of utilities&#39; existing infrastructure by as much as 20%, while maintaining grid asset loading within current design limits. The collaboration will integrate Itron&#39;s Grid Edge Intelligence solutions, Schneider Electric&#39;s Digital Grid solutions, and Microsoft data and AI solutions to facilitate seamless data flow and provide visibility into distribution grid bottlenecks.&quot;",StockTwits

Attached is page 1 of a 9-page Piper Sandler analyst report on MSFT issued today entitled: &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;; Meeting Recap on Azure, Capex, Stargate, and ME5&quot; Piper has an &#39;Overweight&#39; rating on MSFT with a $520 price target. Piper&#39;s &#39;Conclusion&#39; regarding MSFT in the report is as follows: &quot;The majority of investor questions while hosting investor meetings with Jonathan Neilson (VP, Investor Relations) and Josh Elvidge (Finance Director, Investor Relations) last week centered around three main topics including 1) Azure and the variables impacting growth, 2) Capex+lease spend priority and criteria, and 3) Stargate Project impact on the OpenAI relationship. We maintain a positive stance on MSFT based on a broad product offering, healthy commercial RPO that grew 34% y/y, strong operating cash flows of $100B+ annually, and an at-scale $13B+ AI business growing triple-digits. These factors could help better position the company to weather a choppy macro, in our view, which has recently pressured MSFT shares to decline 11% in 3-mo (vs. -5% S&amp;P 500).

President Trump, who paused a federal law demanding TikTok&#39;s sale because of national security concerns related to its ties to China, has said he will give the app more time for a deal if needed. Previous reports have indicated that Oracle (ORCL) is considering a proposal for a sale of the U.S. operations of TikTok that would have it provide security assurances and take a small stake in a new American entity while potentially leaving the app&#39;s algorithm in Chinese hands, while several other companies have privately expressed interest in participating in a deal for TikTok or its American operations, including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), according to previous reports.

ByteDance has been told to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok by April 5 or face a U.S. ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.

Oracle (ORCL) is considering a proposal for a sale of the U.S. operations of TikTok that would have it provide security assurances and take a small stake in a new American entity while potentially leaving the app&#39;s algorithm in Chinese hands, while several other companies have privately expressed interest in participating in a deal for TikTok or its American operations, including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), according to previous reports.

Weak Guidance History: In Q2 FY2025, Microsoft issued a Q3 revenue forecast of $67.7 billion to $68.7 billion, well below the $69.78 billion consensus estimate. This cautious guidance triggered a 6% stock drop in after-hours trading on January 29, 2025. If the upcoming earnings include similarly conservative or downward-revised guidance—perhaps due to AI capacity constraints or macroeconomic uncertainty—it could reinforce fears of stagnating growth, amplifying technicians chart pessimism.

The hype around Manus stemmed in part from growing U.S. interest in Chinese-made AI products thanks to the huge success of DeepSeek, a Chinese-built large-language open-source model that claims to rival offerings from Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT and Meta Platforms (META) but using a much smaller budget.

While this is great news for the datacenter plays in general, it&#39;s not as great for Coreeweave itself. Their strategic advantage was capacity at a time where capacity was limited. While capacity is still extremely limited and WS underestimates the amount of capacity necessary to enable both ML (training) and inference, Coreweave&#39;s strategic advantage is diminishing with every permit issued.

This move was seen as critical, with sources suggesting that without NVIDIA’s support, the IPO might have failed entirely. The situation was described as a “disaster” by some observers, highlighting concerns about demand for AI-related stocks amid a volatile market and broader skepticism about the sustainability of AI infrastructure investments.

According to the company&#39;s advice, H3C&#39;s stock of the H20 chip is almost depleted; fresh deliveries are not anticipated until mid-April. The alert ascribed the supply strain to disturbances in raw materials and world trade uncertainty. H3C also said that changing transportation issues and manufacturing limits would keep delivery unpredictable beyond April 20.

Up, down, up, down, up, down and so on and as of now, it&#39;s sitting near exactly where it was four years ago. Four years ago! Even with the recent large losses spread out across the market you&#39;d have a hard time finding a mid to large cap that has an SP today that it had four years ago. Yeah sure, the whole trading thing...of course, high liquidity, high volatility, traders&#39; paradise, etc... but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;m talking about investments. Why would the average jane or joe investor want this garbage in their portfolio? It&#39;s a loser. That&#39;s a simple fact. It does not return worth a damn. And for those who want to reply with, &quot;well, if you bought in 2009, etc...&quot; don&#39;t bother. Not talking about that. Talking about right now and its history since the masses began buying it. And that history sucks. And none of that even addresses the political aspect of this crap enchilada. It&#39;s simple. I don&#39;t own it. I haven&#39;t, since the QwitterX takeover. Traded it, but why ever own it? Look at $MSFT, totally hammered down lately, but four years ago it was at 220&#39;ish. Still way above, still supplying great safe returns. $AAPL was at about 140. Still way above after slamming. Just look through them all. Tesla...it just makes no sense as an investment. And especially now when it could be halved in value again, soon, very soon heh heh heh, down to that siren song trend line of about 137. Or what if something happens to musk? The stock would circuit break down for a week straight. Why? Why would anybody want this garbage in their portfolio? Yep. In my book, $TSLA as an investment...nope. No way. And that&#39;s without the political stuff. Just based on its SP history. And throw fundamentals in there and it&#39;s even a worse prospect for an investment. Yep.

It is not yet clear whether the White House has approval for the proposed structure of such an arrangement from China, the author says. Under the president&#39;s proposal, TikTok America would be approximately 50% owned by new U.S. investors and license the platform&#39;s algorithm from ByteDance, the author says, noting that existing ByteDance investors would have a roughly one-third interest, while ByteDance itself would retain a 19.9% stake.

Denting sentiment further was a move by China on Friday to impose additional tariffs of 34% on all U.S. imported goods beginning April 10. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday that it was “becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected.” Speaking at a conference, Powell said the economic effects of the tariffs likely “will include higher inflation and slower growth.” Meanwhile, the U.S. added a much stronger-than-expected 228,000 jobs in March. How long that strength will last is now a question as employers factor in tariffs and government layoffs.",StockTwits

For any U.S. stock listed both in the U.S. and Europe — like NVIDIA, Apple, or Microsoft — buying directly on U.S. exchanges like Nasdaq is smarter. You get better pricing, tighter spreads, and more liquidity. Plus, you fully benefit from today’s favorable exchange rate. Later, if the dollar strengthens again, you can earn additional profits when converting your dollars back to euros. This strategy offers two potential gains: stock price growth and currency appreciation. For long-term investors, now is the perfect time to build positions directly in U.S. markets.",StockTwits
2025-04-05 05:44:47,"$NVDA $TSLA $MSFT $AAPL Why European Investors Should Buy U.S. Stocks Directly in Dollars European investors can maximize their exposure to U.S. stocks like NVIDIA by buying them directly in dollars on American exchanges. With the euro currently strong (around 1 euro = 1.11 dollars), you receive more dollars for each euro invested. This means you effectively buy more stock for the same amount of euros compared to purchasing the European listing, where currency conversion is already priced in. By investing directly in dollars, you’re putting a larger percentage of your capital into the actual stock, maximizing your potential returns. Later, if the dollar strengthens against the euro, you also gain from currency movements when converting your profits back. This strategy is about smart currency use: stronger euro at entry, stronger dollar at exit. &gt; In short: buying U.S. stocks directly gives you more stock ownership and double the opportunity for gains.",StockTwits

Key insight: Buying U.S. stocks in dollars when the euro is strong gives more stock exposure and an extra profit opportunity from future currency moves — ideal for both private and institutional investors.",StockTwits
