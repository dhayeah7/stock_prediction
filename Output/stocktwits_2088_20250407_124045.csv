I&#39;m all for PUTS but PSA for anyone new hoping to cash in tomorrow.

Be careful with puts Monday morning. 

The market is set to gap down hard, and volatility is already elevated. If you’re thinking about buying puts at the open, realize that most of the move may already be priced in.

When volatility spikes, put premiums go up — but if IV drops after the open (IV crush), those premiums can fall fast even if the market keeps dipping a bit.

Unless you’re already holding puts from before the drop, buying them during the crash probably won’t pay off much, and might even lose value.",StockTwits,Bearish

Example: €10,000 Investment in U.S. Stocks

Current EUR/USD: 1 EUR = 1.0960 USD

€10,000 → $10,960 invested

If the dollar strengthens:

New EUR/USD: 1 EUR = 1.0500 USD

2025-04-05 05:44:47,"$NVDA $TSLA $MSFT $AAPL  Why European Investors Should Buy U.S. Stocks Directly in Dollars

European investors can maximize their exposure to U.S. stocks like NVIDIA by buying them directly in dollars on American exchanges.
With the euro currently strong (around 1 euro = 1.11 dollars), you receive more dollars for each euro invested.
This means you effectively buy more stock for the same amount of euros compared to purchasing the European listing, where currency conversion is already priced in.
By investing directly in dollars, you’re putting a larger percentage of your capital into the actual stock, maximizing your potential returns.
Later, if the dollar strengthens against the euro, you also gain from currency movements when converting your profits back.
This strategy is about smart currency use: stronger euro at entry, stronger dollar at exit.

&gt; In short: buying U.S. stocks directly gives you more stock ownership and double the opportunity for gains.",StockTwits,Unknown
2025-04-05 05:36:48,"$NVDA $TSLA $MSFT $AAPL 

Investment Tip: Why European Investors Should Buy U.S. Stocks Directly

With the euro currently strong against the dollar (1 EUR ≈ 1.11 USD), European investors have a unique opportunity.
For any U.S. stock listed both in the U.S. and Europe — like NVIDIA, Apple, or Microsoft — buying directly on U.S. exchanges like Nasdaq is smarter.
You get better pricing, tighter spreads, and more liquidity. Plus, you fully benefit from today’s favorable exchange rate.
Later, if the dollar strengthens again, you can earn additional profits when converting your dollars back to euros.
This strategy offers two potential gains: stock price growth and currency appreciation.
For long-term investors, now is the perfect time to build positions directly in U.S. markets.",StockTwits,Unknown

2025-04-04 21:22:53,"Rumour: TikTok deal was largely finalized which would have spun off TikTok&#39;s US ops into a new company owned &amp; operated by a majority of US investors/companies. The deal was approved by existing investors, new investors, ByteDance and the US govt but fell apart after President Trump on the same day announced sweeping global tariffs, including on China. 
 
China has put the deal on hold after indicating they will reject the deal over Trump Tariffs. China is ‘unhappy’ about tariffs. Any agreement would be subject to China approval. 
 
ByteDance representatives contacted the White House to inform them China would no longer approve the deal unless negotiations on the tariffs could take place 
 
China faces a 54% aggregate tariff on goods imported into the US, and has retaliated with 34% in counter tariffs. 
 
President Trump issued an executive order pushing back the deadline for 75 days to finalise an agreement 
 
Prematuring tariffing.

President Donald Trump said the U.S. is close to revealing a plan that would spare TikTok from a U.S. ban, Stephanie Lai, Ryan Gould, and Annmarie Hordern of Bloomberg says. Additionally, Trump reiterated he is willing to offer tariff relief in exchange for China&amp;#39;s help approving the eventual sale of the platform by ByteDance but has &amp;quot;no knowledge&amp;quot; Chinese authorities would adopt this approach.  
 
This comes a day after Trump reviewed a proposal from a consortium of US investors, including Oracle (ORCL), Blackstone (BX), and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz that has emerged as a top contender, people familiar with the matter added.

Trump to announces plans for TikTok America proposal, Information says 
 
U.S. President Donald Trump intends to announce later on Wednesday plans for a new company to be known as TikTok America, as part of his attempts to reach a deal to keep the video streaming app alive in the U.S., The Information&#39;s Kaya Yurieff reports, citing a person close to the discussions. It is not yet clear whether the White House has approval for the proposed structure of such an arrangement from China, the author says.  
 
Under the president&#39;s proposal, TikTok America would be approximately 50% owned by new U.S. investors and license the platform&#39;s algorithm from ByteDance, the author says, noting that existing ByteDance investors would have a roughly one-third interest, while ByteDance itself would retain a 19.9% stake. Companies reportedly aiming to buy TikTok or invest in a U.S. version of it include Amazon (AMZN), AppLovin (APP), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL).",StockTwits,Unknown

Even with the recent large losses spread out across the market you&#39;d have a hard time finding a mid to large cap that has an SP today that it had four years ago.  
Yeah sure, the whole trading thing...of course, high liquidity, high volatility, traders&#39; paradise, etc... but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about.  
I&#39;m talking about investments. Why would the average jane or joe investor want this garbage in their portfolio?  
It&#39;s a loser. That&#39;s a simple fact. It does not return worth a damn.  
And for those who want to reply with, &quot;well, if you bought in 2009, etc...&quot; don&#39;t bother. Not talking about that. Talking about right now and its history since the masses began buying it. And that history sucks.  
And none of that even addresses the political aspect of this crap enchilada.  
It&#39;s simple. I don&#39;t own it. I haven&#39;t,  since the QwitterX takeover. Traded it, but why ever own it?  
Look at $MSFT, totally hammered down lately, but four years ago it was at 220&#39;ish. Still way above, still supplying great safe returns. $AAPL was at about 140. Still way above after slamming. Just look through them all.  
Tesla...it just makes no sense as an investment. And especially now when it could be halved in value again, soon, very soon heh heh heh,  down to that siren song trend line of about 137. Or what if something happens to musk? The stock would circuit break down for a week straight.  
Why? Why would anybody want this garbage in their portfolio? 
Yep. In my book, $TSLA as an investment...nope. No way. And that&#39;s without the political stuff. Just based on its SP history. And throw fundamentals in there and it&#39;s even a worse prospect for an investment.  
Yep. The Lemire Report, if it was official, which it isn&#39;t, it would be officially downgrading $TSLA from Worthless POS to Entirely and Undeniably Worthless POS.

China&#39;s H3C, one of the country&#39;s largest server makers and a key original equipment manufacturer for Nvidia&#39;s AI chips, warned of a looming shortage of the H20 chip, according to a client advisory cited by Reuters. The H20 is currently the most advanced Nvidia AI chip legally allowed for export to China under United States restrictions. According to the company&#39;s advice, H3C&#39;s stock of the H20 chip is almost depleted; fresh deliveries are not anticipated until mid-April. The alert ascribed the supply strain to disturbances in raw materials and world trade uncertainty. H3C also said that changing transportation issues and manufacturing limits would keep delivery unpredictable beyond April 20. Rising acceptance of affordable AI models created by Chinese firm DeepSeek has fueled demand for the H20 chip in recent months. $QQQ $MSFT $AMZN $GOOGL",StockTwits,Bullish

Remember this video I shared with you 1 month ago here... 
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWV5b6SwDsI&amp;t=1s 
 
How its going... 
 
“Nvidia (NVDA)-backed CoreWeave (CRWV) priced its initial public offering well below the official range...cloud-computing startup had effectively slashed the IPO’s size and price range during the day.” IBD 
 
And then there was this… 
$NVDA which already holds a 5% stake in $CRWV reportedly stepped in with a $250 million anchor investment to bolster the offering. This move was seen as critical, with sources suggesting that without NVIDIA’s support, the IPO might have failed entirely. The situation was described as a “disaster” by some observers, highlighting concerns about demand for AI-related stocks amid a volatile market and broader skepticism about the sustainability of AI infrastructure investments. 
 
This narrative was further fueled by reports of $MSFT, a major CoreWeave customer, canceling significant data center leases, raising questions about the startup’s revenue stability",StockTwits,Bearish
2025-03-28 13:28:55,"$CRWV $QQQ $ORCL $MSFT $NVDA I can understand why WS views this Coreweave rush to IPO as a red flag for the datacenter buildout. But to their defense, the truth is, there still exists a ridiculous appetite to build out datacenter operations. The amount of issued permits grows seemingly double digits every day. While this is great news for the datacenter plays in general, it&#39;s not as great for Coreeweave itself. Their strategic advantage was capacity at a time where capacity was limited. While capacity is still extremely limited and WS underestimates the amount of capacity necessary to enable both ML (training) and inference, Coreweave&#39;s strategic advantage is diminishing with every permit issued. Again, this has nothing to do with the hardware input ASP&#39;s, because demand is still ridiculously high, but rather, Coreweave&#39;s diminishing strategic advantage and a roadmap to its own profitability.",StockTwits,Unknown

This cautious guidance triggered a 6% stock drop in after-hours trading  on January 29, 2025.

Trump &#39;willing&#39; to lower tariffs on China to do TikTok deal, Reuters reports 
 
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs on China to get a deal done with TikTok&#39;s Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the app, Reuters&#39; David Shepardson and Dawn Chmielewski report. ByteDance has been told to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok by April 5 or face a U.S. ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law. Trump is willing to extend the April deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached, according to the report.  
 
Oracle (ORCL) is considering a proposal for a sale of the U.S. operations of TikTok that would have it provide security assurances and take a small stake in a new American entity while potentially leaving the app&#39;s algorithm in Chinese hands, while several other companies have privately expressed interest in participating in a deal for TikTok or its American operations, including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), according to previous reports.

Let me get this straight: Oracle wants to handle TikTok’s data while they’re STILL under investigation for leaking 6 million records and compromising 140,000 businesses? 
 
And the proposal to &quot;secure&quot; TikTok’s data involves... Oracle providing security assurances? The same Oracle that can’t even secure its own infrastructure? 
 
This isn’t a solution. It’s a national security nightmare. 
The FTC, HHS, SEC, INAI Mexico, PIPEDA Canada, EU GDPR, all of them are closing in. 
 
If Larry Ellison thinks he can hand-wave away these investigations with some phony “security assurances,” he’s sorely mistaken. 
Oracle’s credibility is shot. And the world is starting to see the truth.

Why would any company trust Oracle with their data when they can’t even protect their own?

TikTok framing itself as &#39;savior&#39; of Americans in new ad campaign, NYT reports  
 
As TikTok faces a U.S. ban on April 5, the ByteDance-owned app has a new ad campaign framing TikTok as a &quot;savior&quot; of Americans and a &quot;champion&quot; of small businesses, The New York Times&#39; Sapna Maheshwari reports. President Trump, who paused a federal law demanding TikTok&#39;s sale because of national security concerns related to its ties to China, has said he will give the app more time for a deal if needed.  
 
Previous reports have indicated that Oracle (ORCL) is considering a proposal for a sale of the U.S. operations of TikTok that would have it provide security assurances and take a small stake in a new American entity while potentially leaving the app&#39;s algorithm in Chinese hands, while several other companies have privately expressed interest in participating in a deal for TikTok or its American operations, including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), according to previous reports.

Attached is page 1 of a 9-page Piper Sandler analyst report on MSFT issued today entitled: 
 
&quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;; Meeting Recap on Azure, Capex, Stargate, and ME5&quot; 
 
Piper has an &#39;Overweight&#39; rating on MSFT with a $520 price target. 
 
Piper&#39;s &#39;Conclusion&#39; regarding MSFT in the report is as follows: 
 
&quot;The majority of investor questions while hosting investor meetings with Jonathan Neilson (VP, Investor Relations) and Josh Elvidge (Finance Director, Investor Relations) last week centered around three main topics including 1) Azure and the variables impacting growth, 2) Capex+lease spend priority and criteria, and 3) Stargate Project impact on the OpenAI relationship. We maintain a positive stance on MSFT based on a broad product offering, healthy commercial RPO that grew 34% y/y, strong operating cash flows of $100B+ annually, and an at-scale $13B+ AI business growing triple-digits. These factors could help better position the company to weather a choppy macro, in our view, which has recently pressured MSFT shares to decline 11% in 3-mo (vs. -5% S&amp;P 500). Buy the weakness.&quot;",StockTwits,Unknown

Itron, Schneider Electric expand Microsoft collaboration on Grid Edge 
 
The company states: &quot;Itron (ITRI) and Schneider Electric (SBGSY) are expanding their collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to deliver a comprehensive Grid Edge Intelligence solution that addresses utility grid visibility and control challenges. This collaboration takes advantage of Itron&#39;s distributed intelligence technology, accelerating the path to bring grid edge intelligence to the utility control center. This will improve grid reliability by establishing high-bandwidth, real-time and scalable data integration between the companies&#39; systems and enable the use of AI and big data analytics.  
 
For utilities, this means unlocking a range of new use cases that improve overall efficiency of the distribution system, its reliability and service restoration during unplanned events. This collaboration of industry leaders in grid edge intelligence, energy management, automation, AI, data, and analytics will further enable utilities to manage the electric distribution grid with a myriad of use cases that require central control system applications to share enormous amounts of data with low latency.  
 
The companies are bringing to market a non-wires solution that addresses utility challenges during a critical period of infrastructure constraints where lead times for components like transformers are upwards of one to two years. With this non-wires solution, utilities can optimize the grid edge and central control system, enhancing grid capacity of utilities&#39; existing infrastructure by as much as 20%, while maintaining grid asset loading within current design limits.  
 
The collaboration will integrate Itron&#39;s Grid Edge Intelligence solutions, Schneider Electric&#39;s Digital Grid solutions, and Microsoft data and AI solutions to facilitate seamless data flow and provide visibility into distribution grid bottlenecks.&quot;",StockTwits,Unknown
